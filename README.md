# HP-game

[The Project outline](https://github.com/oliverjam/fac-react-project/blob/master/README.md)

Phat and Helen bring you... a game!

* To Do:
- [x] Let you submit a username
- [x] Query the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/)
- [x] Populate a UI with the user details
- [x] Have some form of persistent state and interactivity
- [ ] Have integration tests! (and units tests if they're relevant)

* Try to:
- [x] Write modular code: one component per file
- [ ] Separate your container logic from presentational components
